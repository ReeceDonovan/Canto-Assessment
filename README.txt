You are responsible for enhancing a Book Management System.

In the provided zip file, you will find two services that need to be run locally. The backend service has basic functionality to support the existing frontend code, while the frontend project has basic functionality, but no styling at present.

To set up the services locally, please refer to the README files included with each project.

Your tasks include:
- Replace the "Published Date" text field with a date picker component.
- Style the web application as you see fit, utilising any libraries or frameworks of your choice.
- Integrate the provided backend API "deleteBook" to enable book deletion functionality in the app.
- Add a graphQL query to the backend service to support filtering books by date.
- Enhance the frontend project to add the ability to filter out old books.
- Write unit tests for the system functionality (some initial tests have been included to guide you).

Please dedicate a few hours to the project, focusing on showcasing your approach and skill set. We're not looking for a perfect solution but are more interested in understanding how you tackle the problem, your coding practices, and how you manage the tasks within the given time frame.
